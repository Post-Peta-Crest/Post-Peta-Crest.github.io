title: Development of System Software Technologies  
       for post-Peta Scale High Performance Computing
---

JST CREST Post-Petascale software project aimed to establish software technologies to explore extreme performance computing beyond peta-scale computing, on the road to exascale computing. Several research and development has been conducted for system software enabling us to exploit maximum efficiency and reliability from high performance computing systems composed of general purpose many-core processors as well as accelerators including GPGPU from the second half of 2010's to 2020’s. The research topics covers from system software such as programming languages, compilers, runtime systems, operating systems, communication middleware, and file systems to application development support software and ultra-large data processing software. As well as conventional technologies for large-scale numerical computation, the project was also able to address the storage technology required for big data processing, the complexity of memory hierarchy, and the power problem. Exploration for the direction of future high performance computing is also an urgent and significant agenda in our research area.
